This homework consists of the following problems. All problems cover material from the textbook chapters 7, 8, and 12.

<ol>

 <li>Calculate the overall speedup of a system that spends 65% of its time in calculations with a processor upgrade that provides for 125% greater throughput.</li>

 <li>Suppose your company has decided that it wants to make certain servers faster. Processes in the workload spend 60% of their time using the CPU and 40% on I/O. In order to achieve an overall system speedup of 25%:

  <ol>

   <li>How much faster does the CPU need to be?</li>

   <li>How much faster does the disk need to be?</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Suppose the daytime processing load consists of 70% CPU activity and 30% disk activity. Your customers are complaining that the system is slow. After doing some research, you have learned that you can upgrade your disks for $1,500 to make them 2.75 times as fast as they are currently. You have also learned that you can upgrade your CPU to make it 1.5 as fast for $2,000.

  <ol>

   <li>Which would you choose to yield the best performance improvement for the least amount of money?</li>

   <li>Which option (the CPU or the disk) would you choose if you don’t care about the money, but want a faster system?</li>

   <li>What is the break-even point for the upgrades? That is, what price would we need to charge for the CPU (or the disk – change only one) so the result was the same cost per 1% increase for both?</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Name four types of I/O architectures. Where are each of these typically used and why are they used there?</li>

 <li>a) Which of the RAID systems described in this chapter cannot tolerate a single disk failure?</li>

 <li>b) Which can tolerate more than one simultaneous disk failure?</li>

 <li>a) What is the difference between multiprogramming and multiprocessing?</li>

 <li>b) What is the difference between multiprogramming and multithreading?</li>

 <li>Why is the execution environment of a Java class called a virtual machine? How does this virtual machine compare to a real machine running code written in C?</li>

 <li>We stated that the performance of a Java program running in the JVM cannot possibly match that of a regular compiled language. Explain why this is so.</li>

 <li>Into which class of networks do the following IP addresses fall?

  <ol start="52">

   <li>230.7.1</li>

   <li>17.44.39</li>

   <li>255.255.255</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Scavenger Hunt: <em><sub>In your own words</sub></em>, write a short paragraph to answer the following: Who is Vinton Cerf and why/when did he win the ACM Turing Award?</li>

</ol>
